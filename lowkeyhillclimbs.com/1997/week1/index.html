Well over double the 1996 turnout resulted in the first-ever two-wave start
as the Low-Key Hillclimbs opened the 1997 season in spectacular fashion.
Tracy Colwell was back, faster than ever in his
Low-Key Hillclimb leader's jersey, to demolish by 84 seconds
Henrik Johannson's 
<a href="http://lowkeyhillclimbs.com/1997/1996/result1.html">1996
record of 27:04</a>. Henrik's time would have earned him only fourth
place in '97.

Meanwhile, newcomer Alison Buxton of Cyclecraft blitzed the climb in 33:20
to lead the women's standings, although
<a href="http://lowkeyhillclimbs.com/1997/1995/results_week01.html">Laura
Stern's 1995 record of 31:42</a> remains intact.
Julie Colwell finished fourth among the women to give
Team Colwell the team lead, while Scott Rienhardt's solid 29:39
supported Buxton's result to put Cyclecraft in second place.  TNT,
back in strength for '97, leads the women's team standings thanks
to strong rides by Kirsten Neubauer and Mickey Weinberg.
AV's Mike Denardi and Kevin Fox put Alto Velo at the top
of the men's team rankings.
</p>
<p>
Special thanks go to this week's volunteers!  Despite the huge turnout,
and the fact that week 1 is by far the most challenging week to pull off
due to the processing of release forms, things went smoothly. 
This bodes extremely well for the coming weeks, when an expected high
fraction of returning riders will make the registration process much
easier.

    <H2>Nothing worth protecting anyway...</h2>
    <p> 
    At least four riders removed their helmets during the Montebello climb.
    Our insurance requires all riders wear a helmet at all times.
    If you want to remove your helmet, fine, but you're
    not a part of the Low-Key event, and won't appear in the results.
    That and no use of aero bars during mass-starts are the two key
    rules to remember.

    <H2>Overview</H2>
<!----- insert description here----->
    <P><B>Opening day!</B> Do you have the pre-series jitters? That's
      understandable, because even though this series is <I>low-key,</I> the
      energy is <B>intense!</B> Oh sure, we are here to have fun, but who are
      we fooling? Riding(or racing) uphill is never totally fun. Who will show
      up this year? There will be those who just want to make it to the top.
      There will be those who last year could be heard mumbling &quot;just wait
      until next year.&quot; Well, next year is here! Maybe someone heard about
      Tracy Colwell's exciting performances of last year and would like to
      partake in this excitement-a challenge perhaps? After the promenade to the
      base of Montebello Road, the horn will sound, and then it's time to enjoy
      the 3rd year of what has turned into a celebration on wheels! Great views
      along with some tough grades make Montebello Road ideal for kicking off
      the series. We hope to see you there! And bring a friend or family member.
    </P>

    <H2>Prepare to be shot!</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="http://got.net/~grather/">Gary Rather Photography</a> has announced plans
    to be at the climb!!!  So wear your current club jersey, adjust your
    helmet,  and remember the key to
    good cycling shots -- forget the camera is there; allow it to be
    an invisible eye on the action.  Keep your eyes up the road, think
    about what an incredibly strong climber you are, and the shot will
    come out great!
    </p>
    <p>
    Photos will be available for sale after the event,
    either at following climbs or via
    Gary's web site.  Watch this site for more info!
