<h3>Report</h3>
<p>We reach the end of another fantastic year of Low-Key Hillclimbs!  Thanks to all the coordinators, volunteers, and riders for making this year's series a spectacular success.  Hopefully we see a lot of you at the party on 10 Dec, and hopefully plenty of Low-Keyers take the excellent fitness they earned in the series to the San Bruno Hillclimb on New Years Day.

<p>In the women's overall standings, it was a tight contest between McLovely Brown and last year's overall #1, Lisa Penzel.  After volunteering week 1 and two very strong results weeks 2 and 3, McLovely was in a strong position.  Lisa, meanwhile, had to stop mid-way up Montebello due to the afteraffects of oral surgery, then had a tepid week 2 with Montevina + dirt.  But after volunteering week 3, she came on strong, making up ground each week until she sealed the deal at Mt Hamilton.  McLovely had another very strong week 6, and coupled with two volunteer weeks, finished a strong second just a few points back.  Marty Scott held a strong third position for most of the series, while former Low-Key #1 Janet Gardner finished a solid fourth.

<p>In the men's group, it was a very close battle between 100% club member Stefano Profumo and David Collet.  Head-to-head they were close.  But Stefano used a few no-shows by David gain more throw-away scores, giving him a slight edge.  David, however, used his excellent dirt skills to put up a crushing score in week 8, Montara Mountain.  With only Mount Hamilton left, Stefano finished ahead, but the tactical nature of that climb reduced the scores of the top riders, and both Stefano and David discarded that last result.  So it was David taking the overall #1 by approximately 4 points over Stefano, with late-comer Bill Laddish, who skipped the first three weeks and eventually discarded his week 4 score, putting up impressive numbers for weeks 5 through 9 to take the final podium spot.  Carl Nielson looked to be making a similarly late run at the #1 spot after missing out on weeks one through four, but wasn't able to make Mount Hamilton, and finished best of the four-score riders.

<p>The Hybrid-Electric winner was once again Bill Bushnell, who looked like he might have some serious competition at Montebello, but soloed away from there for the overall victory.  In the running division, it was all about Montara, as trail running super-legend Gary "the" Gellin blitzed the Montara course to solidify a lead in the men's running division, while Casey Roberts conquered the mountain to take the women's #1.

<p>In the team competition, it was another come-back story, as The Brown Zone looked ot have it wrapped up in the early weeks.  With late participation by first Carl Nielson, then runner Gary Gellin, and dirt-recruit Keith Hillier Sisters and Misters of No Mercy overtook The Brown Zone with one week to go and held off a Brown Zone onslought at Hamilton to take the team overall.  Led by Stefano Profumo, Bike Trip/Symantec finished an impressive third.

<p>For most improved, it was Bike Trip/Semantec's Eddie Santos showing a super-impressive 23 point boost from 2012 to take that ranking.  He was a regular contributor to the team's points, and was a key player in their podium spot.  Joe Sullivan and Bart Niechwiez took the rest of the podium, each improving by more than twn points from last season.

<p>The most consistent rider for the year was Terrance Kloeckl.  This is a bit of moody standing, but with five of his seven scores within a just one point spread, there's no questioning Terrance showed remarkable consistency throughout the year.

<p>The top weekly scores were both on the dirt, with David Collet and Keith Hillier sprinting it out for the win at Montara.  Gary Gellin gave Sisters and Misters the remarkable 2/3 of the podium in this category.  The entire podium was from Montara with the dirt climb highlighting riders' (and runners') skill.

<p>The top age-adjusted score was Mary Ellen Allen, who rode excellently all year, but scored her best at Montebello Road.

<p>And in the big guys competition, it was Chris "Watts" Evans doing the best mass-adjusted score.  Chris has been climbing extremely well late this year, and didn't slow down at all for the Low-Key series.

<p>The 100% club was an elite one this year, with Stephen Fong, Mark King, and Stefano Profumo having attended every one of the nine climbs in the series this year.  Stephen is tied for the all-time lead in most Low-Key Hillclimbs attended, and was clearly intent upon not giving up that #1 position.

<p>We'll see you all next year, starting with the MegaMonster Enduro in Feb!

<h3>Team Total Rider Scores</h3>
<p>Different than the team ranking, this is the simple sum of scores, including volunteer median scores,
for all riders from every week on each team.  It's an alternate team ranking where every qualifying rider,
every week, adds to the team's sum.  This might be also called the &quot;megateam ranking&quot;
Obviously small teams should look elsewhere.
