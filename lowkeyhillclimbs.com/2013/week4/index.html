<h2>Cover your head, not your ears...</h2>
<p>
Sorry, folks!  Our insurance requires all riders wear helmets during the climb, and we follow the USA Cycling rule against ear buds or other head phones.  Rock to tunes <em>before</em> the climb, perhaps, but we need riders to pay attention to what's happening <em>during</em> the climb...
</p>


<h2>Directions</h2>
<p> This week presents a series of short, challenging climbs around Portola Valley.  Rider time will be based on climbing time, not the time riding from one climb to the next (within a limit). </p> <p> The different aspect of this week is it will use ride data recorded on Strava.  Low-Key software will download the ride data from the Strava web-site and apply our customized timing algorithms to determine the rider times between checkpoints.  So to get a score from this climb, you need access to a <a href="http://www.strava.com/" class="a">Strava</a> account (they're available free).  Then you can record your ride using either a specialized GPS device or a phone with GPS.  If you don't have one, feel free to ask on the Low-Key mailing list, and you can surely borrow one.  Note we're not taking GPS data directly, nor are we taking data recorded on Garmin Connect or other web sites: only Strava, since we did a considerable amount of code development using the Strava API and want to make use of that rather than develop methods for other data sources. </p> <p>Study the route carefully, as this week presents a navigational challenge in addition to a physical one.  Ride the route continuously, in order, any time on Saturday.  You have plenty of time to get from the summit of one climb to the base of the next riding at a moderate pace.  In every case 10 mph average (including stop time) is plenty.  For the climb to Joaquin you have one hour to descend Golden Oak then climb the 690 vertical feet to the base of that climb.  Barring multiple mechanical delays, this shouldn't be a challenge for any Low-Keyer regulars.  So save the legs for Joaquin. </p> <p> The start is at the Alpine Inn at the intersection of Arastradero Road and Portola Valley Road.  However, riders will surely want to warm up before this, so it is recommended those driving part elsewhere.  For example, there are parking areas at the 280 exits at Sand Hill Road, Portola Valley Road, and Page Mill Road.  Sand Hill will give the quickest escape route from the top of the final climb, while Page Mill provides a nice short route over Arastradero Road to the start of today's fun. </p> <p> The route is challenging: one guy tried to ride it without navigation and I think he's still out there.  <a href="http://www.blog.ultracycle.net/2010/05/courses-on-the-garmin-edge-500" class="a">Franz Kelsch has some nice directions</a> on how to use navigation with the Garmin Edge 500. </p> <p><a href="http://connect.garmin.com/course/2691777" class="a">The course is on Garmin Connect</a>.  From the Garmin Connect page, select &quot;Send to Device&quot; with your Garmin plugged into the USB port.  Then when it's done, unmount your Garmin, unplug it from the USB, then turn it on.  For example, in the Edge 500, if you hold the &quot;Page/Menu&quot; button, then go to &quot;Training&quot;, then &quot;Courses&quot; it should be there. <p>Alternately, we also have the route (starting across the street from Arastradero on Alpine, just east of the turn onto Golden Oak) on <a href="http://bikeroutetoaster.com/Course.aspx?course=492721" class="a">BikeRouteToaster</a>.  BikeRouteToaster provides turn-by-turn directions, and allows printing of a queue sheet. <p>A third option is Paul McKenzie's set of routes on RideWithGPS.  These avoid the problem of the course crossing itself, which causes Garmin units to become easily confused.  The down-side is you need to follow the courses in sequence.  Don't waste more than a few minutes starting the next course, however, since there's time limits: <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/routes/3563238" class="a">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/routes/3563276" class="a">part 2</a>, and <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/routes/3563284" class="a">part 3</a>. <p>The best option, perhaps, is old school: we also provide a <a href="cuesheet.pdf" class="a">pre-formatted cue sheet</a>, suitable for taping to a top tube: <ul> <li><a href="cuesheet.pdf" class="a">Cue sheet in PDF format</a> <li><a href="cuesheet.ods" class="a">Cue sheet in OpenCalc format</a> (OpenOffice) </ul> </p> <p> Second, riders will probably want to ride in small groups.  The timing code will allow riders to go as slowly as a 10 mph average (6 min per mile) via the preferred route from the top of one climb to the start of the next.  If you ride slower than this, the extra time will be added to your total.  So regroups at the top of climbs, within reason, shouldn't be a problem. </p> <p> Riders are responsible to ride safely and with respect for other road users at all times.  There's no rush to get from one climb to the next.  So just spin, relax, chat, and prepare yourself for what lies ahead. </p> <p> In the case of wet weather in the forecast we may modify the route in the days before the climb.  So watch these pages if it looks like rain's in the picture! </p> <h3>Route details:</h3> <ol> <li><b><a href="http://app.strava.com/segments/3225753" class="a">Climb #1: Golden Oak (E)</a></b> to Peak <li>Descend other side to Alpine Road <li>Turn right on Alpine, ride past intersection with Portola Valley Road, and keep climbing. <li>Watch on the left for Joaquin Road.  This road climbs steeply to the left.  You have 1 hour to get here from the top of Golden Oak.  This shouldn't require climbing at a hard pace or taking any risks on the descent.  Take it easy and save your legs. <li><b><a href="http://app.strava.com/segments/689383" class="a">Climb #2: Joaquin Road</a></b> T @ Old Spanish Trail. <li>At the top, turn left on Spanish Trail.  Go with the flow on the descent until you come to Los Trancos.  Descend that until it flattens out and eventually intersections with Alpine Road. <li>Turn left on Alpine Road.  Look for the right for Hillsview, the next climb.  You have 25 minutes to get here from the top of Joaquin. <li><b><a href="http://app.strava.com/segments/717848" class="a">Climb #3: Hillbrook</a></b>.  This is short but sweet.  You need to start this climb to the east (a right hand turn from Alpine), not the west.  Climb to the top, which is just past the last right hand turn before the straight to Sausal.  You have 15 seconds to complete the right turn from Alpine before starting this climb.  If you want to restart, repeat the right turn from Alpine, don't just go to the bottom of the climb and turn around. <li>At the top turn left at the T.  This is Sausal.  Follow that to the end, then go through the gate, and ride the trail until you emerge on Cherokee.  Watch out for the chain which can be difficult to see (<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/8hEdZ" class="a">Street View</a>). <li>Turn left and ride to the T with Cerventes. <li>Turn R on Cervantes to the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/OWum6" class="a">base of the climb at Kiowa</a>.  This is climb #4.  You have 10 minutes to get here from the top of Hillbrook. <li><b><a href="http://app.strava.com/segments/652366" class="a">Climb #4: Cerventes</a></b> to Peak. <li>Turn R on Peak to Golden Oak. <li>Turn left on Golden Oak.  Descend back to Portola <li>Turn R on Portola.  Ride to the the western intersection of Golden Oak.  A right here takes you to climb #5.  You have 10 minutes to get here from the top of Golden Oak, the precding climb. <li><b><a href="http://app.strava.com/segments/3226079" class="a">Climb #5: Golden Oak (W)</a></b>: to Peak.  You must start this climb from the east (right-hand turn), not a left from Alpine.  That would result in a time penalty.  Don't pause at the bottom of the climb: you have fifteen seconds to get from right before the right turn to right after the right turn.   This is plenty of time if you just keep pedaling.  If you restart, restart from the east, on Alpine Road, repeating the right-hand turn. <li>Left on Peak to Cervantes.  It's a bit of a ride to the next climb, but it's worth it.  Summit Spring is the steepest climb of the day, and the spin to the base will be very good for your legs.  You have 45 minutes to cover the 10 km to Summit Spring: no problem. <li>Left on Cervantes all the way to Westridge (R also goes to Westridge, but out of the way). <li>Left on Westridge to Portola Valley Road. <li>Right on Portola Valley Road <li>Bear L on Portola Valley Road at Sand Hill and Mountain Home (stay on Portola Valley Road) <li>Right onto Highway 84 (this is essentially straight from Portola Valley Road) <li>Left on Tripp from 84.  Watch for Summit Spring on the left.  This will be the final climb of the day. <li><b><a href="http://app.strava.com/segments/265535" class="a">Climb #6 Summit Spring</a></b> all the way to the end.  The actual finish is the first of two driveways in the final straight, so make your effort there, but keep it rolling all the way to the end, as fast as you can go, in case of GPS position errors. </ol> <p> You're done!  While you're there you might want to descend Summit Spring part way (the final steep climb) then turn left on Patrol.  That descends to an intersection with Entrance Way.  If you stay on Patrol it is a nice out-and-back which may have the steepest grade of the day.... just in case you haven't gotten enough. </p> <h3>Additional Comments:</h3> <ul> <li>GPS isn't perfect, so you'll want a running start and finish at all of these climbs so if there's a position error, the timing code doesn't catch you napping at either the bottom or top.  Start at least 10 meters before and keep riding to at least 10 meters after to make sure you've crossed the line.  This is an issue on Summit Spring, which is a dead-end, so the actual "line" will be adjusted as need arises to make sure it catches all of the GPS tracks of riders who road to the very end.  Ride it <em>all the way</em> to the end.</li> <li>If you have a mechanical problem immediately after starting a climb, as long as you still have time remaining to arrive at the start from the finish of the preceding climb, you can return to the start of this climb, recross the line in the correct direction, and the time for the aborted start will be allocated to the travel time from the previous climb.  Note some climbs (Hillbrook and Golden Oak W) must be approached on a right-hand-turn.  If you want to restart these climbs you need to repeat the right-hand-turn as well, so backtrack on Alpine a bit first.</li> <li>If you cross a finish line more than once, the clock starts ticking to reach the next climb after the first finish line crossing, not the last.  But why would you want to cross a line more than once?</li> <li>The climbs must be ridden in sequence.  Don't repeat any climb but the present climb.  For example, if you go back to the first climb after doing the fourth climb, it would be a mistake.  Do climb 1, then climb 2, etc through climb 6. <li>Turn on your GPS before reaching the base of Golden Oak and don't worry about turning it off at the finish: the timing code ignores riding before and after the course (in fact, if you do two full laps on the same GPS activity, it will take your fastest, then it will report you to the authorities for psychiatric examination).</li> <li>You have a nice warm-up before Summit Spring.  Spin an easy gear to flush the lactic acid: you've got 45 minutes to cover the 10 km there.  You want to absolutely kill that last climb, or it may kill you. </ul> <h3>Safety Rulez:</h3> <ul> <li>On some hills, in particular the Golden Oak climbs and Hillbrook, it may be tempting to gain a speed advantage by approaching them from other than the most direct approach.  The timing code will check if you approach from the correct side.  If you approach from the wrong direction, for example missing a turn to start a climb then turning back to make the turn from the opposite direction, if in our judgement this might offer a speed advantage, the code will assess a time penalty.  So please follow the route in the direction indicated.  This only applies to turns at the base of climbs, at all other turns, there is no speed incentive to go off the nominal route.  The turn is essentially part of the climb (with a 10-second time budget), so if you stop part-way up the climb and want to restart these climbs, make sure to include the turn. <li>No drafting of motorized vehicles or of hybrid-electric bicycles is allowed this week.  Hybrid-electrics are allowed, of course, but must ride solo. <li>Of course, helmets are required by our insurance, and traffic code must be obeyed at all times.  Safety first: this is Low-Key. </ul> <h3>Time Limits</h3> <p>Summary of time limits for getting from one hill to the next... these are all super-relaxed, plenty of time for faster riders to wait for slower riders: <center><table border=2 cellpadding=3> <tr><th>segment</th><th>distance</th><th>time limit</th></tr> <tr><td>Golden Oak E to Joaquin</td><td>7.73 km</td><td>60 minutes</td></tr> <tr><td>Joaquin to Hillbrook</td><td>5.18 km</td><td>25 minutes</td></tr> <tr><td>Hillbrook R-hand turn</td><td>41 m</td></td><td>15 seconds</td></tr> <tr><td>Hillbrook to Cerventes</td><td>1.38 km</td><td>10 minutes</td></tr> <tr><td>Cerventes to Golden Oak W</td><td>2.11 km</td><td>10 minutes</td></tr> <tr><td>Golden Oak W R-hand turn</td><td>27 m</td></td><td>15 seconds</td></tr> <tr><td>Golden Oak W to Summit Spring</td><td>10.15 km</td><td>45 minutes</td></tr> </table> </center> </p> <h3>Route maps</h3> <ol> <li><a href="week4_guide.pdf" class="a">PDF route guide</a> for the Portola Valley Hills course.

<h2>The Low-Key Way</h2>
<p>
Low-Key is all about a group of friends riding up a hill together.
It's like any other informal group ride, except we time you to the top
and report the results on our web site.  But we have no road closures,
no lead vehicle, no follow vehicle.  We are traffic, sharing the roads
with other traffic, following the laws and courtesy which applies to
traffic.  Think of it as a human-assisted <a href="http://www.strava.com/">Strava</a>.
We're each responsible for our own actions out there, on and off the
bike, both as users of the road as as courteous visitors to the
neighborhoods we pass through.  &quot;Ceci n'est pas un race&quot;.
