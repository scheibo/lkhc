<h2>Low-Key at San Bruno</h2>
<p>
Congratulations to all the Low-Keyers who participated in Pen Velo's <a href="http://peninsulavelo.org/secondary/events.html#SBHC">San Bruno Hillclimb</a>!</b>  Low-Keyers were at the top of the <a href="http://www.ncnca.org/road/2008/MtSanBrunoResults.html">the standings</a> in several categories, with series leaders Tim Clark finishing second in the first wave behind E12 winner and Low-Key Montebello champion Chris Phipps, Tim winning the 35+, with women's leader Janet Martinez finishing second to Low-Key runner-up Lucia Mokres in the women's elite 4.  Low-keyers did well in most categories.  I'm sure Pen Velo appreciates our strong support for their event, as we appreciate their granting of free entries to Low-Key point leaders.

<h2>Just Can't Get Enough!</h2>
<p>
The Low-Key Hillclimbs are back for 2007!  Low-Key founder and refounder
Kevin Winterfield has been deported to Lands East, but Low-Key continues,
with 2007 series coordinators Patt Baenen, Dan Connelly, and Pete Heller.
Come on out, and, if you've enjoyed climbs in the past,
volunteer to help out, or even coordinate a week!  Coordinators get
to ride the entire series for free, while volunteers get 2 free weeks
per week volunteering
(<noscript><img src="2007/email.png"></noscript><script language="JavaScript">displayEmail("djconnel","yahoo","com","Low-Key Hillclimbs","");</script>)
!
</p>
<h2>The Now</h2>
<p>
After a few enthusiasm-fueled seconds on the lowest slopes, the large
pack quickly dispersed, leaving you surrounded by with a core
group, some familiar from previous weeks, others new.
These are your companions for the climb, <i>your</i> competition.
Riders further ahead, others further behind, no longer matter,
no longer exist.  They are your true competition, but also your allies.
They are your stimulus, your stimulus for the shelter of the moment, for
looking into yourself as you look outward to them.  Surely you cannot
keep their pace.  Surely you will crack.  The temptation floats in the
air, whispering in your mind: let them go, slow down, enjoy the view.
But you suppress the thoughts, confine the growing discomfort in your
legs and instead embrace it, embrace it as part of your being, part of
<i>who you are</i>.  The distance to the top no longer matters.  You
are in the <i>now</i>.  And you hold the pace.
</p>
<p>
Returning again, after the Grand Return of 2006, the 2007 edition of
the Low-Key Hillclimbs.  You are ready.
</p>
<p>
The philosophy of the Low-Key series is to allow each cyclist, no matter
what his or her level, no matter what his or her speed, to establish goals,
and meet them.  It's all about the hill, the rider, and being at one with the
bike.  We'll see you there.
</p>

If you can, you'll want to <b>print and fill out the <a href="http://www.usacycling.org/forms/waiver.php?url=rider_release.pdf" target="_blank">PDF release form</a></b> before the event.

<h2>Getting There</h2>
<p>
To avoid congestion and other headaches please do the following:
<ol>
<li>park legally (ok, goes without saying, right :)
<li>park away from the climb location and ride to the registration and
staging areas - this avoids masses of cars and bikes, which isn't
good. Plus, you need a warm up anyway, right? Most, if not all, of
these climbs have ample parking within a good warmup distance from the
registration, staging and the start.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Better yet, ride to the start, or take public transit!
The relaxed Low-Key start time make riding and/or taking the
train an excellent option.  See
<a href="http://www.caltrain.com/">Caltrain's website</a> for train
schedules, or <a href="http://www.511.org/">511.org</a> for BART
and bus options.  Bike route info is also available from
<a href="http://bicycling.511.org/routes.htm">511.org</a>.
</p>
<h2>The Low-Key Way</h2>
<p>
The low-keys are just what you want them to be. We do time and keep
track of times and points, but by no means is that the main reason
for these climbs. They're for having fun, checking out the area
climbs, and meeting people.
</p>
<p>
A wide spectrum of folks climb this series - and you can create your
own team and category.  Or, better yet, choose an existing category,
for a bit of friendly Low-Key competition.
</p>
<p>
For those new to Low-Keyin', the process is simple:
</p>
<ol>
<li>you show up at the start (we like to encourage people to ride to
the start to minimize congestion), register, sign the release, get
your special NUMBER STICKER that you place on your handlebars
(something people keep throughout the series, and the years...
anyone still have their sticker?)
<li>then depending on the climb, we either mass start the group, or
start you in small groups, or individually..
<li>you climb to the top at your own pace - some fly up, others sit
and chat with friends and other riders
<li>when you reach the top, you yell out your number (which is funny
to watch as some folks can barely speak), we record the time,
<li> then you can eat our array of bananas, fruit drinks, etc and
socialize with the folks at the top.
<li>About a day later, we place the times on the website along
with &quot;points earned&quot; (<a href="2007/scoring.html">details available here</a>)...
each week we do this and tally the votes until the end when...
<li>we have the final ceremonies for several categories we make up -
some standard ones, some unexpected.
</ol>
