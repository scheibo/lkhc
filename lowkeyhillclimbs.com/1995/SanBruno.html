<h1>1996 Mount San Bruno Hillclimb</h1>
distance=3.5 miles;  climbing=1070 feet<br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
The 1996 racing season began in Northern California with a record-
smashing climb up Mount San Bruno.  Glen Winkel had set a record of
16:17 last year in this decades-old event.  This year the organizers
offered a special $100 prize to anyone who could set a new record.
Winkel didn't return to defend his title, but six riders responded to
the challenge by coming in ahead of the previous record!  The winner
was unattached mountain biker Dave Meyer, who finished in 15:02.  I
expect that more will be heard about him in other road events this year.
</p><p>
George Mount, who has set a number of hill climbing records himself,
worked as chief judge for this event.  Spectators at the finish line
enjoyed a spectacular panoramic view of the San Francsico Bay area
under sunny skies with temperatures in the 60's.
</p><p>
Included in the lead bunch, all of whom finished withing 45 seconds of
each other, were two category 4 riders, who should be considered for
prompt upgrading.  The winner of the category 4 event was Dave McAteer
of the Tecate team with an outstanding time of 15:23.

Monday January 1, 1996 10:00 a.m. the 1996 racing season commenced.
The weather was unbelievably warm, the times were positively HOT, and
the prizes were plentiful.
<p>
Many thanks to Skaates Plumbing, Petrolium Ventures, Bianchi, Visa,
and MLO for the many wonderful prizes.  The first women up the hill
won over $300 in cash and prizes.
</p><p>
The best time up the hill, smashing last year's record of a bit over
16 minutes, was Dean Meyer (15:02!!!) who scored $100.00 plus cash
and prizes. Who knew San Bruno could be warm, sunny, and lucrative?
</p><p>
There were familiar faces, new jerseys, and some fabulous comebacks.
</p><p>
The top two women were in the 18 minute bracket.....fast folks.
One of the several husband/wife racing teams featured Donna and Lynn
Merard....Lynn had hip replacement surgery last year.  He started late
because he pinned on his wife's number, offered to wait for her, and
finished the climb with a smile and good cheer.  Great job Lynn!

<h2>Note on times</h2>
Least-squares fitting of an equation of the form
<i>time = A distance  + B climbing</i> to the Low-Key 
Hillclimb data, and analysis using the <em>Whitt and Wilson</em>
bike power-velocity-grade-mass-rolling resistance equations
yield the same conclusion, that times between San Bruno and Old La Honda
should differ by roughly 10%.
