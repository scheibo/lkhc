Scoring in the Low-Key Hillclimbs is simple!
</p>
<h3>individual scores</h3>
<p>
For each event, a rider receives a score equal to 100 times the ratio of the median time for his/her gender
and his/her time up the hill.  For example, if there's 41 riders, and the 21st rider gets a time of
40 minutes, and your time is 50 minutes, you get a score of 100 * (40/50) = 80 points.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the series, your overall score is calculated as the sum of your five best scores
from the nine weeks: you get four throw-aways.  These throwaways become available at weeks two, four,
six, and eight, so after three weeks, for example, it's top two scores.
</p>
<p>
And of course, to get a score, you need to wear your helmet.  Sorry, kids!
</p>
<h3>team scores</h3>
<p>
Team scores are calculated using the top <i>three</i> riders in each team for a given week.
Overall team score is calculated using the same number of weeks as individual overall scores.
</p>
<p>
One complication: any team volunteers in a given week score, for the purposes of
overall team score only, their average score in all weeks in which they participate
as a rider.  This rule, &quot;The Heller Rule&quot;, prevents teams from being penalized
for having riders volunteer.
</p>
<h3>most improved rider</h3>
<p>
There will be a special category for &quot;most improved&quot; rider.  This is determined
using the slope of a regression of the natural log of the score, versus the week number,
for riders with at least four scores at the end of the series, or a pro-rated number of,
weeks during the series, with a reduction in the required number of weeks for volunteers.
</p>
<h3>endurance competition</h3>
<p>
There will be a special ranking for riders who have accumulated the most total climbing
time during the series, acknowledging their superior demonstration of endurance
