<font size="2">   <b><em>The 1996 Low-Key Hillclimb Series</em></b> will take place from 05 October to
   28 November, on consecutive Saturdays leading to the finale on
   Thanksgiving Day.  All levels of rider and bike are welcome -- the point
   is to have fun during the off-season, not high-intensity competition.
   Results, with team and individual scoring by rider-assigned category,
   will be posted to the internet.  Each week registration will be from
   10:00am to 10:20am and is only $3.  Contact Kevin Winterfield at
   408-226-4753.
