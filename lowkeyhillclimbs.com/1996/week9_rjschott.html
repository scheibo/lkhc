Low-Key Hill Climb<br>
Installment 9: Mount Hamilton Road
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
Ride Report: fin-de-siï¿½cle 
Thanksgiving 1996, Mt. Hamilton
</p>
<p>
The turnout for the last of the Low-Key rides was robust, despite the
promise of miserable weather.  It was an appropriate setting for the
Armageddon of the 96 hill climb series, with Team 
<em><a href="http://www.webville.com/oak/ww/TnT/"><b>T<small>N</small>T</b></a></em>
 and Alto Velo
set to engage in the final battle for team dominance on the ascent.
Several Alto Velo vertical heavyweights made an appearance, including
John and Linda Elgart and the recently recruited Michael DiNardi. The
Alto Velo apostate, Kevin Winterfield, has found his form but is
riding for team "Low Key".  The QOM, Liz Beneshin didn't make it, so
it appeared to be a dogfight for those precious points to the 1 and 2
climbers from each team and the outcome was in doubt as I milled
around the start with many of the other riders, thinking "I'm too
cold to warm-up". 
</p>
<p>
Everyone massed at the intersection of Armageddon and Olympus Rock
roads and after brief speechifying, videotaping, and a few stills, we
bolted into action like a herd of rabid buffalo in a western revival.
 Within a mile or two from the start we were in the clouds and
experiencing an ominous drop in the temperature.  Pheromones, I
suppose drifting back from the climb leaders, seduced many of us to
excessive efforts on the front climb where a number of riders flirted
with a bonk, and others consummated the affair.  I'm sure it was Dan
Connelly I came across by the side of the road, smoking a cigarette
and asking no one in particular, "Was it good for you, too?"
</p>
<p>
My own personal drama unfolded a few townships back of the main
action, where I clung like a piece of dry lint to Mark Anderson's
wheel once I caught up with him at the top of the front climb.  I
recognized the symptoms of "Went out too fast" syndrome, somewhat
similar to my own, which include heavy legs and heavy breathing.  I
kept thinking, "When's the descent start?" as we motored along
through the mist.  We finally crested the arc, and with the road wet
and Grant Park enveloped in a patchy cloud bank, I got a taste of the
chill that would grow Arctic in magnitude by the observatory
(aggravated by a spasm of machismo I had stripped to just a jersey
and shorts, dumping jacket, warmers and other expedition accessories
into the 
<em><a href="http://www.webville.com/oak/ww/TnT/"><b>T<small>N</small>T</b></a></em>
 car).
</p>
<p>
I was pleased to start the second set of climbs, just for the warmth
of it.  It was a steady progression of cat and mouse with a few other
riders. I was trying to catch teammate Pete Heller, who managed to
find this week's ride prior to the start. Some distance up the final
climb, Kevin Merritt passed me on his descent from a earlier climb.
He grinned at me, "Are you gonna let the guy with the funny bike beat
you?".  I was, at that moment behind the fellow with the funny yellow
bike, thinking, "Beat him? I'm going to catch him and steal his
shirt."   
</p>
<p>
Our relative positions now ossified, we continued threading the
endless switch backs, looking for some sign of the top.  The last
section along the front face of the observatory mount offered up a
penetrating headwind, and despite the fact I had been climbing
steadily for 7 miles, I was quite cold.  I sprinted through the
finish giving my best effort to find the 
<em><a href="http://www.webville.com/oak/ww/TnT/"><b>T<small>N</small>T</b></a></em>
 car for a few layers of
clothing.  We chilled out, waiting for the accumulation of enough
finishers to begin the award ceremony.  Kevin herded us into the open
room at the far end of the Observatory which quickly accumulated its
own internal weather system from the humid vapors of the attendees.
Various category winners were awarded their certificates and medals,
and it appeared that Alto Velo had taken team honors, on the efforts
of Michael DiNardi and either John Elgart or Gordon Good.  This was
coupled with the misfortune of Mike Podgorsky of 
<em><a href="http://www.webville.com/oak/ww/TnT/"><b>T<small>N</small>T</b></a></em>
 who jigged when
e should have jagged and was apparently overtaken by a chase vehicle
on his descent toward Livermore.  He was rerouted and finished with
an honorable time (<em>Note: Mike's time was later revised to
where he likely would have finished without the incorrect turn</em>).
In a moment of high drama, Dan Connelly burst
through the greenhouse doors and contested the team award to AV.
Kevin, whose next posting should be in the former Yugoslavia,
proceeded to award both first and second place finishes to both AV
and 
<em><a href="http://www.webville.com/oak/ww/TnT/"><b>T<small>N</small>T</b></a></em>
 pending the final tabulation.  He had covered all the bases.
I was allowed to keep the cycling medallion for team effort, hastily
awarded to AV prior to Dan's arrival, although I did offer to return
it pending the final tabulations.  However, it looks like it's ours
for the AV trophy case.
</p>
<p>
The rolling award ceremony still in progress, I lurched out the door
on legs now seized up like a pair of unoiled pistons, presumably from
the extremes of temperature and sudden cessation of activity.  I
could barely rotate the cranks, and such efforts were accompanied by
attention-grabbing pain in the quads. I rolled off the top, satisfied
that I wouldn't need to pedal for the next 7 miles and therefore the
pain in my legs would not distract me from the frostnip in my hands
and feet.
</p>
<p>
Despite the hardships and toil, it's a letdown that the Low-Key
season is over.  Much credit is due Kevin Winterfield and Dan
Connelly who have nurtured this into a seminal event.  New talent has
been drawn into the sport on the strength of their enthusiasm and
efforts.  Many thanks.  And stay tuned, the racing season is just
around the corner.
