It's time this series came out of the closet. I used to associate the
concept of "low-key" with leisurely, non-competitive, perhaps even lazy.
Kevin Winterfield has helped me redefine low-key.  Kevin and Dan
Connelly, a congenital organizer and an obsessive number manipulator,
have done a great job putting this whole thing together. I'm sure Kevin
could put together a successful figure skating champtionship in hell. But
this is "Low-Key" like finding your backyard was formerly a toxic waste
dump is low key.  Then again, if it really were just a "fun ride" I
wouldn't be there.
</p>
<p>
Today's event was a scenic sprint from the San Gregorio Store to the top
of Old West LaHonda.  Except today was rather chilly and foggy so there
wasn't much  scenery, except perhaps the other participants, many of them
milling about the stove at the General Store trying to keep warm before
stripping down to the bare essentials for the sashay to the top.  I
looked out the window to see the fellow with the "low-key" disc wheel
warming up, right next to the gentleman with the "low-key" time trial
helmet on.
</p>
<p>
I set out at the assigned time with little water and no spare or pump, in
keeping with the low-key tradition of absolutely minimizing the weight
for the climb.  I wandered along, splayed out over the aerobar with a
heart rate at a touristy 173 BPM sucking in air like a Harrier Jump Jet.
I passed perhaps 10 or 12 riders along the way.  When one came into view,
I thought to myself "target acquired".  I zeroed in but fortunately had
no missiles to arm and fire.  I kept waiting for faster riders to pounce
on me, but they were far enough back so that I wasn't overtaken.  One
fellow periodically appeared behind me and seemed to be gaining.  This
inspired me to bound along perhaps a bit faster with the sense that I was
being stalked by a stronger predator in keeping with the Darwinian
nature of these low-key undertakings.  I sprinted across the line and
seized up by the side of the road trying to figure out if my time was a
good one.  This hasn't been done before so nobody really knew.

Mark Rodamaker motored across, drowning in his various secretions and
momentarily breathless.  Once restored, we chatted for a minute and
watched Mark Anderson dash across.  He pulled up, looking a bit gray.  I
asked him how he did and he opened up and out gushed breakfast, by all
appearances quite a calorie-fest.  I applauded him on his effort up the
hill and then realized he was tottering on his bike.  I helped haul him
off the bike and into the dirt, where he lay in quiet repose, next to his
twice scrambled eggs.  Mark R. and I then stood nearby admiring the
totality of his effort.  Shortly afterwords Liz Beneshin came over, and
after being steered away from the accident site which she nearly trod
through, commented, "How can you guys sit next to that spew!" before
wandering off with a "eeewwwww".  It's a guy thing, I guess.  Mark R.
commented that Mark Anderson deserved a yellow jersey, perhaps chunky
yellow, or maybe egg yolk yellow.

We waited for the Low Key cycling god, Tracy Colwell to appear to gauge
precisely how meager our efforts really were.  Amazingly he beat me by
only a minute.  This is amazing because he had a flat, or rode on a flat
and still kicked my butt.  I was told he fixed it, did a hundred pushups
and then saved several children from a burning orphanage before jumping
back on his bike to then speed up the hill, turning in a respectable time.
</p>
<p>
I drove Mark back home and he seemed to recover nicely.  His last comment
to me was, "Gee, I'm kinda hungry now".
</p>
<p>
Can't wait until next week.
