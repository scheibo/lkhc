Wedged between those cruel instruments of torture, Bohlman-On Orbit-Bohlman
and Hicks-Loma Almaden, week 7 of the 1996 Low-Key Hillclimb series was
a respite from the marathon climbs.   With under 750 feet of climbing
from the start to the top of Joaquin, today's ride was a sprint in
comparison to the surrounding weeks.
</p>
<p>
<img src="cloudy.jpg" align="right" height="69" width="69">
Yet the ride, through chilly air beneath the threatening overcast, wasn't
easy.  What's lost in distance and time is gained in intensity and
concentration.  From the "killermeter" to RAAM, all events in cycling
demand 100% from the rider, and it is the ability of the rider to so provide
that determines success.  Of all the climbs in the series, Alpine-Joaquin
placed the greatest emphasis on a good warm-up, a solid start, and
the mental discipline to put the body right at the edge of failure, to
spend the last bit of strength at the finish, and no sooner.... to give
everything to the course.
</p>
<p>
Too easy?  If yes, you could have pushed harder.... gone faster....
done better.  Riding at the edge... it's what courses like this demand,
and no excuses are granted.
</p>
<p>
Unless you're Tracy Colwell.  Tracy blitzed the course in under 12 minutes,
finishing, on a day where seconds are precious, over a minute
ahead of the rest.  Tracy now
has clinched the overall top score in the men's division, as has
coordinator Liz Benishin that of the women.  Tracy has proven himself
over everything from the epic slopes of Diablo to this week's sprint
up Alpine, and is thus the worthy wearer of the leader's jersey.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Today's ride is a study in contrast.
</p>
Riders will meet at the intersection of Portola Valley Road and
Alpine Road in Portola Valley, part of the (in)famous Portola
Valley ``Loop''.
<p>
<img src="p3.jpg" align="right" height="214" hspace="5" width="141">
The start will be at the stop sign at the top of the opening "wall",
where the road levels to become a blissful, meandering, narrow path
through the open space preserves near Windy Hill.  The ever-winding route,
amidst the peace of the tree cover, lulls you into a state relaxed
introspection.  Ahhh..... life is good.
</p>
<p>
Gradually, though, the route steepens.  The effort increases.
Downshift.  A little steeper...... out of the saddle.  Still,
not too bad.... it won't last long, you tell yourself.
</p>
<p>
Then, you arrive.
</p>
Not at the finish, but at the intersection of Alpine Road and Joaquin
Road, just a stone's throw from the gate marking the end of the paved
section of Alpine Road.  As you turn left, the road turns up....
<p></p>
<p>
The bliss is broken.  The introspection is over.  Now, the pain begins.
</p>
<p>
<font size="2"><em>This week's ride was <a href="http://lowkeyhillclimbs.com/1996/week7_old.html">originally</a>
scheduled for dirt Alpine Road, the section past the turnoff onto Joaquin.
However, a
<a href="http://www-leland.stanford.edu/scoop/romp/Alpine.html">recent landslide</a>
has completely taken out a 50 meter section of the road, requiring riders 
not in the
``<a href="http://www.aero.cst.nihon-u.ac.jp/hpv/hpv-e.html">Daedalus Division</a>''
to use a single-track detour challenging even
for mountain bikes.  Thus for 1996 <em>Low-Key<sup><small></small></sup></em><sup><small>TM<em></em></small></sup>
<small><em>will use the lower section of Alpine instead.
