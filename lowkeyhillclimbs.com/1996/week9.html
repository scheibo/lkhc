With first place locked by Tracy Colwell and Liz Beneshin in the
men's and women's categories, the attention of the world was focused
on the team competition during this, the final week of the 1996
Low-Key Hillclimb series.

led by <a href="mailto:rrobin7617@aol.com">Dick and Roxeanne Robinson</a>,
went into the day trailing local racing powerhouse Alto Velo by 
57 points, 6708 to 6651, with Team Adventure solidly planted in third
position.  Despite the apparent deficit, however,
saavy followers of the standings realized that with their low score
from week 1 due to be devalued to a weighting factor of zero,
<a href="http://www.webville.com/oak/ww/TnT/"><em>T<small>N</small>T</em></a>
needed only a tie to take the lead for the first time in the series;
the only time that matters.

Still, Alto Velo's strength and depth were formidable.  Despite the absence
of team-leader Liz Benishin, Alto Velo was out in force to crush the
uprising of little 
<a href="http://www.webville.com/oak/ww/TnT/"><em>T<small>N</small>T</em></a>.
Of its heavy-hitters, only Giorgio Consentino and Mike Podgorski (who received
an adjusted time toward the overall after missing the final turn) had a solid performance
for the underdogs, with Kirsten Neubauer not starting, 
and I (Dan Connelly) suffering in the
wet, windy, and cold conditions to finish well below expectations.
Alto Velo's cadre of race-hardened minions won the battle and thus the war,
but 
<a href="http://www.webville.com/oak/ww/TnT/"><em>T<small>N</small>T</em></a>
fought valiantly to the end.  The effort will not be soon forgotten.

And none will forget today's climb, with the mist and cold wind
turning this epic into an ultra-epic; all who finished are victors. 
</p>
<p>
And so, the 1996 Low-Key Hillclimbs conclude, leaving only the No-Key Hillclimb
of <a href="weekX.html">Old La Honda</a>.  Hopefully, we'll see you there!

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Upward, further, higher.... you're having trouble remembering what
it feels like to <em>not</em> be climbing.  Does the summit exist?
Will it ever arrive?  Why are you here?  Why did you come?  You
could be home watching football right now...
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.irving.org/cgi-bin/xplore.cgi?lick+hwycutbk+A+D"><img src="D2.jpg" align="left" height="127" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="183"></a>
Finally, ahead, you see it.  The observatory -- your goal.
There is an end to the pain... there will be an end to
the suffering.
</p>
<p>
Yes -- you're almost there.
</p>
<p>
Only five miles to go...
</p>
<p>
This is the finale of the 1996 Low-Key Hillclimb Series.  We've saved the
longest for last --  19 miles and 4300 vertical feet....more climbing
than any 2 other hills in the series combined, neglecting
<a href="week3.html">Diablo</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.irving.org/cgi-bin/xplore.cgi?lick+hwycutbk+A+B"><img src="B2.jpg" align="right" height="128" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="183"></a>
If you are riding to survive, just pace yourself and contemplate the
views of the valley below.  When shrowded in fog, the valley is an eerie
and beautiful sight.  When clear, the expansive views of San Jose and
the surrounding Silicon Valley are..... well.... a matter of taste.
</p>
<p>
If you are riding to go fast, though, you will need to stay totally
focused on the task at hand.  Always, you are pushing yourself, tempting
your threshold of pain, probing your sustainable limits.  Stay relaxed,
focus on breathing, focus on pedalling, focus on the rider ahead....
To achieve your goal, to produce your best time, you need to constantly
focus.... probe,.... push... for all 19 miles of the seemingly endless
road.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.irving.org/cgi-bin/xplore.cgi?lick+obsprk1+A+A"><img src="A1.jpg" align="left" height="126" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="180"></a>
But when you arrive at the observatory, the pain will be forgotten,
but the achievement will remain.  Absorb the view to the east in the
company of your fellow cyclists...while your neighbors are watching
others achieve on their televisions, you are achieving on your own.

When's dinner?
