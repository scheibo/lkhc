<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This is another repeat climb from the
<a href="../1995/results_week03.html">the 1995 series</a>.
Last year, Alto Velo's
<a href="mailto:kurreck@vnet.ibm.com">Tim Kurreck</a>
dominated the rest of the field to conclusively post the
day's best time, beating the hapless second place rider
by over a minute with a time of 36 minutes, 15 seconds.
Whether you're trying to top Tim's result, post a benchmark
time for yourself, or just enjoy the scenic Silicon Valley
view (<i>sic</i>), you are encouraged to come out for the
day's event.
</p>
<p>
You'll want to make sure your shifters are working for this one.
From the start at the Park and Ride at Arastradero Road are 1.2 miles
of mostly flat roads.  Go out too hard, and you'll blow reserves
needed for the slopes to follow.  Go to easy, though, and
the time lost cannot be made up, so don't plan on using this
as your warm-up.
</p>
<p>
From here, the road suddenly and rudely tilts skyward. 
Still, the slope is variable, with grades near
15% over short sections, while much of the climb is shallower
with a few intermediate descents thrown in as well. 
Again, staying in a the appropriate gear, and knowing how
hard to push the pace is key to minimizing your time.
</p>
<p>
The run to the finish is rolling, with short, twisting climbs and
descents.  Don't let up here -- it's too close to the end
to make up time lost to lapsed concentration.
</p>
<p>
After the finish, watch as later riders reach the top, and enjoy the company
of those who arrived earlier.  To return to the start area, either
descend Page Mill Road, learning why it is so highly regarded by
skilled descenders, or ride Skyline Boulevard north to Highway 84
for a high-speed descent into Woodside.  A trip around "the Portola
Valley Loop" will bring you back to Arastradero Road.
