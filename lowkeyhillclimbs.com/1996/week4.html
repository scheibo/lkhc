Temperatures in the low-50's and gusting winds didn't look to quench the
red-hot competitition between 1996 Low-Key Hillclimb revelations
Tracy Colwell of Team Colwell (dominator of weeks 2 and 3) and Henrik Johansson
of Los Gatos BRC
(dominator of week 1).  It was no surprise when, before hitting the ascent,
which begins only
50 meters from the start, Tracy was off the front,
Henrik in pursuit.  The rest of the male
competitors were left to grovel for third place....

<p>
However, the question of who is the faster was put off for at least another
week as mechanical problems brought Henrik to a halt near the Huddart
Park service road, less than a third of the way to the top.
Tracy was alone, and not in the mood for any more company.

And so he posted the fastest time for the third week in succession,
crossing the stop sign in sub-20-minutes to smash
the winning value from
<a href="../1995/results_week02.html">1995</a> by
almost 2 minutes, despite the gusting winds.  He was the only one on the day
to beat last year's mark, further evidence that he will be making himself
known in cycling circles during the coming season.  "He wasn't even
breathing hard," coordinator Kevin Winterfield was left muttering in
stunned amazement.
</p>
<p>
In the women's event, Laura Stern arrived at Skyline first to make it a
perfect 3/3 in Low-Key Hillclimbs
for her, while Liz Beneshin of Alto Velo solidified her lead in the women's
overall category.  They're sizing Liz up for this year's
<a href="leader_jersey.html">yellow jersey</a>,
even as you read this....

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
<a href="mailto:">Kevin Winterfield</a> returns you to
Kings Mountain, one of the top draws during
<a href="../1995/results_week02.html">The 1995 Hillclimbs</a>.
It's an area classic. The weekly Spectrum Cycles Ride
traditionally attacks it each Saturday.  It's smooth surface, steady
grades, moderate auto traffic, and generous supply of shaded switchbacks
make such popularity understandable.
</p>
<p>
Whether you're a Spectrum regular or have never even been to Skyline,
gather for registration near the old store at the intersection of Tripp Road
and Kings Mountain Road in Woodside, CA.  At 10:30, riders will line up
at the intersection of Kings Mountain Road and Greer Road.  Kevin will
then provide some <em>brief</em> (hear that Kevin???) words of inspiration,
hop in his car, sound the horn, and the ride will be on.
</p>
<p>
The task at hand is straightforward -- climb.
<a href="../1995/results_week02.html">Last year</a>
a lead group stayed together most of the way, until breaking apart
a mile from the finish.  This year.... a solo attack from the first
mile?  A leg-rending group sprint up the final straight slope to the line?
We'll see... If someone attacks near the
bottom, do you push your aerobic limits, and struggle to follow?
Or, do you let him go, maintain your own pace, and hope he fades?
</p>
<p>
Whether you're planning on battling for the lead of the pack, win the
mini-race with those climbing with you near the end, or just want
to enjoy the ride up and enjoy the company of others, plan on coming
out for the Low Key Kings Mountain Hillclimb on the 26th.
