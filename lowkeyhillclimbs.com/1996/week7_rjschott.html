</p><h3>
Low-Key Hill Climb<br>
Installment 7: Alpine + Joaquin
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
As much as Bohlman into Orbit is a test of power skills, writing
something about week 7 tests one's skill as an observer of the Hill
Climb Series.  Only 3.6 miles, it was over in a wink.  If likened to
baseball this was the 7th inning stretch; a chance to grab a beer and
some chips in between the heavier action.
</p>
<p>There was some excitement however.  Would we reach the 200th
registrant for the series?  Just when the suspense was becoming
unbearable, Alto Velo's impresario Kevin Winterfield announced to all
within range at the registration area that some unsuspecting,
although undoubtedly deserving woman was the 200th contestant and
thereby entitled to a celebratory water bottle, which I believe he
had just previously found rolling around in the trunk of his car. 
She looked somewhat embarrassed by all the attention and I'm sure
would have been just as happy if they had announced that she had won
a free enema while quietly in line to purchase a hemorrhoidal remedy
at the drug store.  She gamely clutched her prize while we clapped
our appreciation for contributing to the success of the series.
</p>
<p>Would it rain?  The sky was a featureless and slowly deepening bruise
as the rain moved in from the Pacific.  But we got our licks in
before the first drop descended.
</p>
<p>Would Mark Anderson keep his breakfast?  Apparently the chronicle of
Mark's adventure from two weeks ago was widely appreciated as Mark
returned and endured many questions about his morning intake, and
whether he would again share it with us at the top.  I heard it in
the muted comments at the staging area, "Is that the egg guy?"  Mark
smiled through all of this while looking for an appropriate object
with to which bludgeon me.  I kept my helmet on and Mark held onto
his chow.  In a remarkable turn of events he was spotted eating (in
brazen defiance) a Power Bar at the top of Joaquin.
</p>
<p>Adn would Tracy Colwell once again beat the snot out of the rest of
us?  By quite a comfortable margin. He was inquiring about Zipp
wheels after the race, apparently wanting to improve on already
blistering speed.
</p>
<p>Next week, back to a meatier climb with an assault on Hicks and Loma
Almaden.  I suspect a 26 tooth cog for the back or a triple chain
ring up front will make the morning a little more enjoyable.
