<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
</p><p>
The 1996 Low Key Hillclimb Series opens with the same climb which began
<a href="../1995/results_week01.html">the 1995 version</a>, Montebello Road.
Meet series coordinator <a href="mailto:">Smilin' Kevin
Winterfield</a> at Steven's Creek Resevoir to sign in, see acquantenances
from last year, and make new friends for this year.  After a short promenade to
the base of Montebello Road, the horn will sound and the fun will begin.
The 1996 Low-Key Hillclimbs will be on!
</p>
<p>
Montebello Road, with its accessibility, challenging slope, low
traffic volume, and amazing views is a nearly ideal venue to open
the series.  Whether you are testing your pain threshold with the
lead group or just out to enjoy a ride to the summit with your
fellow cyclists, whether you have a Spinergy-equipped custom Merlin
Titanium or an entry-level mountain bike, whether you are riding
400 miles per week or 40 miles per month, and whether you're 
gunning for the series leadership or just out for a workout, 
you'll find the Low-Key Montebello Hillclimbs a great way to spend the morning.
</p>
<p>
After reaching the summit, riders have the option of continuing along the
challenging but rideable fire roads to Page Mill Road near Skyline Road,
from where one can descend to Foothill Expressway to complete the
loop back to Steven's Creek Resevoir.  Or, call it a day and 
just turn around to descend back Montebello.
