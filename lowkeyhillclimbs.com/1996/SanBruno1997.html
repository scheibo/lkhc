<p>
<i>Undeterred by the Biblical-scale deluge and storm-force winds
battering the Peninsula, <a href="index.html">Low-Key Hillclimb</a>ers 
were out in force for
the not-so-low-key launch to the 1997 racing season, the <i>San Bruno
Hillclimb</i>.  And, fresh off their series victories, Men's cat 5
Tracy Colwell and women's cat 3 Liz Benishin (both Alto Velo) showed
the USCF regulars they meant business by taking the overall wins.
Meanwhile, women's cat 4 Julie Colwell (Alto Velo) showed her
contribution to the Team Colwell sweep of the <a href="weekX.html">Old
La Honda <i>No-Key</i></a> was no fluke, as she finished a close
second, thus establishing herself as a USCF force to be reckoned with.
In addition to the cat 3, cat 4,
and overall top women's placings and the overall and cat 5 men's
placings, Low-Key alumni also took first in the men's cat 4, third
in the men's cat 5, and 3rd and 4th in the women's overall.
</i></p>
<p>
<i>Tracy's victory opened the eyes of many in attendance, as he dropped
cat 1 national-champion master's rider Glen Winkle (United States
Postal Service) during the final mist-enshrowded  meters while holding
off a late-charging Casper Rubalcava (cat 3; NorthCoast) to 
cross the line first.  While temperatures were in the cozy low-60F range,
gusting headwinds were a substantial factor in the race.  But even with
Tracy riding from the front during most of the 3.8 mile climb, Glen was
unable to hang on at the end.
</i></p>
<p>
<i>Winkle noted the irony that he received the top prize on the day
(winner -- men's cat 1-2-Pro) despite getting beaten in the finale.
However, given Tracy and Julie's showings to date, it won't be long
into the new year before the top categories have to compete with them
officially as well as unofficially.

public will then be <a href="http://www.usacycling.org/">USCF</a>-licensed for the day, and would rank instead
