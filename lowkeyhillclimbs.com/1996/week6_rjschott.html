Low-Key Hill Climb<br>
Installment 6
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
Another Saturday, another installment in that cruel oxymoron of
growing infamy, the Low-Key Hill Climb Series.  Low-Key (wink) and
Bohlman-into-Orbit don't belong on the same page.  For the vast
majority of us, just maintaining forward momentum up this climb
requires concentration and a persistent coaxing of reluctant limbs
and lungs.
</p>
<p>
We lined up on what was to be a fine morning in the usual mass start
configuration, with the rabbits among us crowding the front and the
less intrepid cowering behind.  Kevin Winterfield worked the crowd
with a few jokes.  (When he hangs up his cleats he should run for
congress, Dan Connelly can be his pollster.)  The starting honk lit
the pack and the rabbits jumped into action.  There were two
populations here:  the usual suspects, led by the first chair and
frequent soloist in the Hill Climb Orchestra, Tracy Colwell, making a
steady dash to the top.  Then there were the rabbits of the stewed
variety who were not able to maintain their early momentum due to
overgearage and/or the relentlessly uphill nature of this morning's
adventure.  The pack strung out into a slow procession and you soon
found your position in the food chain, occasionally jumping up or
slipping back as riders moved by.  
</p>
<p>
I had garaged my lightweight Trek in favor of a touring bike, a tank
by comparison, but with a triple chain ring up front.  A number of
riders had similarly come to this conclusion and there was no shame
today in bringing a granny gear.  The only shame was that my granny
gear had so many teeth:  32, matched with a 26 in back, it  was still
more than enough gear-inches to mash around.
</p>
<p>
I was one of the unfortunate souls who jumped out of the blocks more
briskly than I should have, and by the top of Bohlman #1 I was
squirming around on the bike trying to find a rhythm.  There was none
to be had.  The low point had to be when Gary Gellin ran by me,
ultimately beating me to the top by a couple of minutes on foot.  I
wanted to ask if he'd carry my bike, but was far too short of breath
for witticisms.
</p>
<p>
There was ever so slight a respite at the end of Bohlman, and I
reconfigured my ample and aged payload to launch onto Orbit.  I was
riding along with Holly, one of the top women finishers, trading
places periodically as we chewed up the terrain.  At one section on
Orbit there were several bikes strung out ahead of me, front wheels
flicking back and forth, zigzagging in the sunshine like a school of
salmon struggling upstream.  Holly dropped me on the last section of
20%+ grade, but I gradually pulled back in range.  When the grade
became more manageable, my competitive neurons flicked back on
(standard equipment in most models of the male brain) and my ambition
began writing checks that my legs couldn't cash.  I nearly slid out
on a gravelly turn and she dropped her chain but sprinted back up in
one remarkable burst.  We hammered through the rollers atop Bohlman
redux,  along with another woman on a mountain bike who had closed
fast on the last climb.  The three of us sprinted through the finish
in a gasping Low-Key lunge to the tape.  My thanks to them for the
inspiration to finish with a flourish.
