</p><h3>
Low-Key Hill Climb<br>
Installment 8: Hicks Road and Loma Almaden Road
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
t seemed like a promising day, the weatherman calling for sunshine,
and the legendary noon ride had been a wash the day before so I
showed up on fresh legs.  The first indication that bad Mojo was
rising was my near death experience while warming up.  A woman
motorist got part way around me on Hicks, and then turned sharply
onto Kennedy road.  I attempted to elbow her green Suburban aside,
criterium style, but this thing was at least twice as big as Mark
Rodamaker. I was forced abruptly around the corner with her while
trying to keep out from under her tires.  I suspect that the spatial
orienting areas of her right brain were underdeveloped, or perhaps
damaged from repeated applications of hair spray.  I rode off her
rear quarter panel and then gestured with both arms extended, palms
open pointing heavenward asking, "what was that?"  She motored along
perkily, I suspect oblivious to the whole affair.
</p>
<p>
I rolled cautiously back to the staging area, where the usual
suspects were assembling.  After a few comments by Kevin Winterfield,
smartly attired in his cow jersey, we rolled off.  This being a
Low-Key=81 affair, we leisurely accelerated to around 22 MPH with
Mike Podgorsky (followed by Tracy Colwell) setting the early pace on
the gentle climb to the slopes of hell.  Kevin rolled up and noted,
"kinda like a road race here".  It did have that feel, a nice
reminder of Saturday mornings in the summer, although there would be
a price for this tempo for some of us when the road pitched up.  Just
when I began to believe that all was right with the world, a definite
hissing sound became evident.  I indulged in some magical thinking
("maybe it's a leaf"), but was shortly thereafter confronted with bad
Mojo, round II:  my front sew-up was going flat.  I did the rational
thing at this point, hammering back up to the lead pack lingering
wistfully for a brief moment while my new (and expensive) tire went
completely flat.  I really didn't want to quit, and actually didn't
for a spell, bumping along behind the leaders, contemplating my
options.  I had to let it go though, and wheeled around, without a
spare for the 2 miles back to my car.  Much to my amazement, I
discovered it possible to fly along at about 20 MPH on a flat sew-up.
 It's a bit sloppy in the corners, but quite manageable.  I just
happen to have a front clincher ready to go in my back seat, so my
new goal became restarting and then getting to the top before they
folded operations and went home for the afternoon.
</p>
<p>
I restarted the race with roughly a 14 minute handicap according to
my timer.  I assumed I was in for a lonely ascent, but shortly after
restarting I came across my lost teammate, Pete Heller, astride his
bike at the side of the road.  I rolled past, "C'mon".  He inquired,
"where's the start?"  I nodded up the road, "about 15 minutes that
way".  We debated briefly the merits of hammering vs. just finishing
(need you ask?).  We hit the uphill ugliness and Pete surged ahead
while I chatted briefly with another rider recovering from a
mechanical problem.  Over the wet cattle grate we locked in step with
him about 30M ahead of me.  I lurked predatorily behind him, and made
a move when his cadence fell precipitously at the top of Hicks, sure
sign of a blow.  I could virtually hear his mitochondria exploding. 
But after a very brief rest, he was back in the chase.
</p>
<p>
Roxanne from TNT, "slow and steady" by her admission, came into view.
 And then Judy Colwell appeared in the mists on Loma Almaden, making
steady progress up the steeps.  (Anyone not convinced of the genetic
contribution to endurance need only to study the Colwell clan.)  Judy
rides with a Paddington bear, an Alaska license plate (for a trailer)
and innumerable other artifacts lashed to her bike.  I'm riding
stripped to the bone on carbon fiber without water or a spare (see
above) so the contrast is striking.  Suffering from the usual hypoxic
hallucinosis, the "Grapes of Wrath" appeared to me.  An Oklahoman,
bike loaded with all her worldly possessions (and then some) going
west over Mount Lactate in search of something better (in this case a
banana and cookies at the top).  Paddington's head and arms hung limp
and he had shifted to the side of the rack, giving me a forlorn look
as I ratcheted past.
</p>
<p>
Toward the top, I edged up to Doug Simpkinson, who I had last seen at
the beginning of the race when he turned around to offer me help
while I was sobbing uncontrollably over my flat at the side of the
road.  Doug was riding his Schwinn, I believe the "Armored Car"
edition, complete with fenders and what appeared to be a radio
locator beacon on the rack.  I'm quite certain he's set up for
instrument approaches on that machine, although perhaps that's just
for crash testing when they pitch it out of the back of a plane,
which I'm sure such a "sturdy" bike would survive.  The unique aspect
of the older Schwinn line is that they have enough mass to have their
own gravitational field.  I escaped his orbit and pressed on to the
gate, happy to have a gentling of the climb but now contending with
the stinging cold tendrils of the cloud reaching down from the top of
Mt. Umunum.
</p>
<p>
Doug, Pete and I, after allowing an appropriate interval for the
development of deep hypothermia at the top, looped back around
through New Almaden, or "Deliveranceville" to some local enthusiasts.
 The ratio of cars in the front yard to populace certainly has to
exceed 2:1, inspiring those of us with shaved legs and lycra to keep
up a good pace through town.  No untoward incidents to share, so we
can give this race report a family rating.
