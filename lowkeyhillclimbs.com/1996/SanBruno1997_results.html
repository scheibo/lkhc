<i><font size="5">Report from the Lead Vehicle</font></i>
<p>
I have never been in the "lead" vehicle before, it was
really exciting.  So, here is a view out the back window
as narrated by four racers who decided we felt more like
Phil Ligget than Pantoni.
</p>
<p>
Wednesday morning was wet and windy.  Registration was
under a canopy with a great deal of concern about mud
and rock slides.  The flags above the parking lot area
were sticking straight out from the wind.  We sent our
club president as scout to make sure the road was safe
and clear.  He reported the race would start with a 50
meter tail wind, then a major head wind for the next
three and a half miles.  The road was clear but there
were small rocks and plenty of water.
</p>
<p>
Almost everyone who registered showed up.  There were 5
women and a large group of 45+, more than we expected
overall.
</p>
<p>
This was a mass start as usual and for the 30 seconds
when the riders assembled it looked like the rain may
abate.  It was only a tease, as the officials started
the race the heavens opened again with a new gale of
water and gusts of wind.
</p>
<p>
As the race started three distinct groups formed in the
first 500 meters.  There was a group of around 7 in front
that quickly reduced to 5.  By the time the group reached
the ranger station (around half way) the lead group was
down to 3.
</p>
<p>
The speeds varied from 15 mph on the steep portions to
more like 18 on the less steep climbs.  We were using
the car speedometer so this is a vague estimate.
</p>
<p>
Tracy Colwell (Cat 5) lead almost the entire race.
When the race started he stayed with the lead group and
let them set the pace.  Pretty quickly he took the lead
and never relinquished it all the way to the top.
</p>
<p>
The three at the ranger station were Tracy Colwell,
followed by Glen Winkel, last Casper Rubalcava.  Casper has
a very rocking style of climbing.  It appeared to us he was
struggling just to stay on for most of the race.  In
retrospect that may just be his riding style.  Glen was
breathing hard but did not appear to be hurting.
</p>
<p>
Three or four times Tracy made half-hearted attempts to
move over and let Glen lead.  Glen stuck to him like glue.
The head winds were a major factor.  As noted by Liz, the
women's leader "I am really glad I did not use my Zipp's".
</p>
<p>
Around 1/2 mile to go Tracy started weaving back and forth.
Those of us that do not climb well use this technique of
"paper boying" up a hill to reduce the steepness.  We were
guessing he was trying to force Glen off his wheel since
there were lots of little rocks and gusts there.  I asked
Tracey later and he said he was trying to put Glen in the
wind to minimize the final sprint.
</p>
<p>
Around 1/4 mile or less to the finish is a sharp hill
before the rolling finish.  On the hill Tracy put the
hammer down effectively losing Glen.  Casper seemed to
have some sprint left in him, but not enough.  There was a
clear 2-3 bike length lead when Tracy crossed it.  The
three seconds difference in their finish times does not
show the dramatic difference between the two finishes.
</p>
<p>
There were many very heroic efforts.  Alto Velo swept the
women's division with the top four finishers as well as the
fastest man.  Caryne Mount, who had a baby a few months ago
completed the race.  Three folks RODE their bikes to the
race, an official, a spectator and a racer.  One of the DFL
riders went up the hill on a fixed gear mountain bike.  What
is a little rain to REAL racers?  To my dismay, everyone was
clothed and nobody wore dresses or PJ's.  Guess I have to do
more 'cross for that kind of entertainment.
</p>
<p>
Where was BBC this year?  We missed Narda and some of the
regulars.
</p>
<p>
Most of our photos are awful, the rain and fog limited vision
and the lens got pretty wet.  We will see if we can salvage
any of them.
</p>
<p>
After the race Tracy and Liz were awarded the Hill Climb
Series Yellow Jerseys by Kevin Winterfield.  Classy!!
</p>
<p>
Many thanks to Kevin Keil and Rick Sutton who did registration,
Geo Kitta gave up racing to organize course marshalls, Gene Condon
for the awning, Gavin for medical (thankfully we did not need him),
George Mount and Skaates for taking times at the top of the hill,
Rudy for the porta-potty, Bianchi for all the good prizes, and hosts
of others who helped.
</p>
<p>
What fun.  My rain boots and coat are finally dry.  On to
early birds....
