<h1>Coordinator Info</h1>
</div>
<hr>
<p>
Thanks for helping out!!!
</p>
<p>
The following is a list of things coordinators probably want to do.
The list is sort of long, but it really isn't that much to do.  The biggest hassle
is typing up the results, but that shouldn't take more than an hour or so.
I apologize for typographical errors -- the generating of this list was somewhat
rushed.
</p>
<p>
</p><h3>Things to bring</h3>
<ul>
<li>small stickers for rider stems</li>
<li>markers for numbers</li>
<li>pens for entry forms</li>
<li>copies of all forms available on
<a href="forms.html</i></a>.</li>
<li>copy of
<a href="datafiles.html</i></a>.</li>
<li>first-aid</li>
<li>carbohydrates of choice</li>
<li>drinking water</li>
<li>a high quality camera, preferably digital, if you wish</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>During the Event</h3>
<ol>
<li>Registration</li>
<ul>
<li><em>return riders</em>:
<ol type="a">
<li>fill out only "Weekly" form -- fill in
 rider number and team number.</li>
<li>payment: $3, or $2 if they have ordered a T-shirt.  Free if they
        are a coordinator for one of the weeks!</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><em>first-time riders</em>:<br>fill out:
<ol type="a">
<li>new rider form: this assigns the rider a number, and associates
	him with a category number and sex and URL (optional).
	There is also space for category and team.</li>
<li>all-riders form: this registers the rider number and team number with
	the week's event.  Please remind riders to put down numbers,
	and not names, of themselves and their teams.  Put a "-"
	in for the team if the rider is continuing on the team
	specified from the last week or as specified on the
	new rider form he filled out.
</li><li>release form: It is important this is signed, obviously</li>
<li>payment: $3.  Free if they are a coordinator for one of the weeks!</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> to <em>change previous registered info</em> on a team, rider, or cat:<br>
Fill out the appropriate form as if it was a first-time team, rider,
or cat.
</li>
</ul>

<li>Start riders.</li>
<li>Go to finish.</li>
<li>Take times -- write down rider number, time, and if there is time, a word or two
describing the bike or the jersey in case the number was incorrect.
</li><li>Check that all riders have one and only one finishing time.  It is good
    to check riders off from the registration list during lulls in the finishing
    activity.</li>

<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>After the Event</h3>
<ol>
<li>Type the results:  The results are needed in tabular form.  The format
    is very important.  Tables are needed as follows:<br>
<ol type="a">
<li><em>New Teams</em>:  This list describes teams which have not participated
	    in any previous Hillclimbs.  The membership isn't needed -- that
	    is taken care of in the week's registration list.  The following
	    example shows the format whoich should be used.  No spaces should be
	    found within fields, only between fields.  Note the numbering begins
	    with the integer one greater than the integer of the last team which
	    registered prior to the current week.  "url" is contact info
	    on the web, if it exists.  It can also be of the form
	    "mailto:email-address@host".  Don't worry if the columns 
	    don't line up nicely, as long as they are separated by spaces or tabs:
<br>
<pre><font size="2">
	num     name                    url
	15	Garden_City_Cyclists	-
	16	Sunnyvale-Cupertino_CC	http://www.ncnca.org/sponsor.html
	17	Mako-Silks		-
	18	Genentech		-
	19	Fremont_Freewheelers_BC	http://home.earthlink.net/~mpolakoff/
	20	Saturn			http://www.saturncars.com/Mag/Cycling/	    
</font></pre>
</li>
<li><em>New Categories</em>: This is similar to the new teams table, except
	    it is for categories.  An example follows.  Again, don't worry
	    about pretty formatting -- the results program doesn't care,
	    as long as columns are space or tab-separated.
<br>
<pre><font size="2">
	num     name                    url
        46      recumbent               -
        47      fried                   -
        48      180lb+                  -
        49      just_make_it_to_the_top -
</font></pre>
</li>
<li><em>New Riders</em>: Same story as teams and cats, just different
data. Remember,
only riders who had never before this year done a Low-Key Hillclimb
need be listed. Please, no spaces in names -- use "_" instead.
<br>
<pre><font size="2">

        27  M   5   Begley,Brian     mailto:bbegley@MEM.po.com
</font></pre>
</li>
<li><em>Weekly rider list</em>: Finally, this is the list of those who participated in
	       the week's event.  The order doesn't matter, as long as
	       everyone is listed; for example, you can just use the order in which
	       riders registered if you so wish. Times should be in the format
	       "hours:minutes:seconds"
	       or "minutes:seconds" or even just "seconds".  Seconds can have
	       a decimal with fractional seconds, if you time to such accuracy.
	       Remember to use numbers fr riders and teams, and not names!
