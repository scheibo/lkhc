Such describes Tracy Colwell's assault on the 1996 Low-Key Hillclimb
series.  With crisp, clear weather and gusting winds, he rode
away from the competition, blitzing Diablo's 3250 vertical feet in
close to 50 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Liz Beneshin expanded her lead in the series posting
the fasted time among the women for the second week.  She has a
commanding lead in the standings, but there's still 6 climbs
left to go...

<p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
In
<a href="../1995/results_week05.html">the 1995 series</a>,
Phil Duffy rode away from Lance Waltjen and the rest of the Low-Key
Hillclimbers to arrive first to the summit of Mount Diablo.
</p>
<table width="100%">

<p>
In 1996, <a href="mailto:Ken.Hernandez@quickmail.llnl.gov">Ken Hernandez</a>
and the <a href="http://www.aimnet.com/diablo/vs-home.html">Valley Spokesmen</a>
once welcome you to this, along with
<a href="week9.html">Mount Hamilton</a>,
one of the two truly epic climbs in the Bay Area.
With 3250 feet of climbing over its 11.1 mile length, Diablo
will test your endurance, pacing, and focus beyond the levels
demanded by many of the lesser climbs in the region.
</p>
<p>
Unlike
<a href="week9.html">Mount Hamilton</a>,
there are no intermediate descents here on which to rest.
From the start at Athenian School at the base of South Gate
Road, the climbing begins immediately.  After 6.5
miles of South Gate Road's modest 4.5% average grade, 
it's time to shift down a few cogs for the turnoff onto
6.9% (avg) Summit Road.
</p>
<p>
And, as you approach the finish, watch out -- this devil
has a sting in its tail.
</p>
<p>
Whether you are first to the finish or last, the day will
be worthwhile, as all finishers are richly rewarded not only with
the satisfaction of having conquored this colossus, but also
with what is one of the most panoramic views in the world.
