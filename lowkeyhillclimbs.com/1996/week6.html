Lactic acid ruled the day as Low-Key Hillclimbers launched their
1996 assault on Bohlman-On Orbit-Bohlman.  With the sounding of
the car horn, riders burst from the start in a frenzied dash
to confront Bohlman's wrath.  Even as the road tilted upwards, the
frenetic charge continued.
</p>
<p>
Then, the casualties began to mount....
</p>
<p>
Some riders, facing the grim reality of Bohlman's relentless grades,
surrendered completely, turning back, perhaps vowing to return
another day with better gears, or perhaps better legs.
</p>
<p>
Others, having prematurely driven themselves beyond their aerobic limits,
succumbed to the craving... the pleading... of their legs to pause, to
put a foot down, to rest.
A few seconds of relief,  a few moments to catch the breath.  Then,
more grimly, to continue...
</p>
<p>
Still others, unwilling to touch the ground with their feet, sought the refuge
of driveways, turning tight circles on precious tracts of level tarmac,
to give their legs a respite from the cruel hill.
</p>
<p>
However, others continued on, ignoring the pain, ignoring their bodies...
Up Bohlman, onward.  Up On Orbit, onward. Back onto Bohlman,...onward.
To the finish, where the well-earned rest was granted at last.  The
pain is temporary, but victory is forever.
</p>
<p>
Among these few were 1996 Low-Key Hillclimb champions-to-be Tracy Colwell
and Liz Benishin.  For Tracy, there was no puncture this time, no high-speed
impacts with road debris -- it was just
another week, another crushed Low-Key record.  For Liz, despite her
long racing season and fatiguing weight-room schedule, it was another
solid week's effort to virtually cement her final hold on the Women's
Leader's jersey.
</p>
<p>
But there were others, spread throughout the standings.  They know who they
are... they faced the hill, and beat it at its best.  They were victorious.
For the rest, there will be other chances...  the battle was lost, but
the war goes on.
</p>
<p>
Special mention goes to finisher Gary Gellin, one of the few cyclist capable
of challenging Tracy on these hills.  He finished... on foot.  Low-Key
fans will recall he did a similar feat on the lesser slopes of
<a href="../1995/results_week04.html">Old La Honda Road</a>
in 1995.

Thanks to Roxeanne Robinson for videotaping the riders today as they strugged
up the final, cruellest slopes of On Orbit Lane.  If you want a copy, send
team <em>TnT</em> to reserve one.  Then give him $10 at either weeks 8 (Hicks) or 9 (Mt Hamilton)
and he will give you your copy.  Thanks, Giorgio, for providing the camera
and this service!

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Pain.
</p>
<p>
The experience of Bohlman Road and On Orbit Lane is an exercise in pain.
Face it.... embrace it..... revel in it.....  It is pain which makes
this hill worthwhile,  pain which makes it great.
</p>
<p>
Soon after you leave the cemetary from which the ride begins, having
passed over the opening, flat meters, you will be faced with the brutal
slopes of Bohlman.  You've encountered such slopes before -- Redwood
Gulch, perhaps.  Or, maybe, Joaquin.  However these others are mercifully
short.  Bohlman shows no mercy.  When you have had enough, when the strength
has left your legs, when even your arms start to weaken, the hill goes on.  Another
slope.  Another turn.
</p>
<p>
Then, when you can take no more, when you have reached your limit, when your
body begins to fail you, you reach the turnoff onto On Orbit.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="../1995/results_week09.html">1995 
Low-Key Hillclimb</a> included an assault of Bohlman.  However, construction in
progress last year prevented the On Orbit "detour" from being included.
Pity -- it meant that no matter how great the feeling of accomplishment
of those who took the summit, they were denied the peace of knowing
they had beaten the hill at its best, for only with On Orbit behind you
can the victory be complete.  Thus, we return.
</p><p>
While Bohlman takes away your strength, On Orbit consumes your will
to continue... to live.  Do not stop.  Do not rest.  To do so
would be to admit defeat, to succumb to the hill.  Turn the pedals.
One more stroke.  And another....
</p>
<p>
Yet even when On Orbit is conquered, the road continues upward.  Bohlman is back.
While not as steep as what precedes it, after everything
has been given to the hill, even these "moderate" slopes can claim you
as their prey.
</p>
<p>
The pain..... seemingly endless, yet the end comes at last.  Accept
the challenge, embrace the pain.   In the end, it makes you stronger.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Note: Riders may wish to descend the dirt road to Montevena, from which one can
descend to Highway 17.  A short distance to the west is the climb of Black.
Either alone or in conjunctin with the Gist Road turnoff, one reaches Skyline,
from which a ride to the north brings one to the Highway 9 summit.  Descend
9 into Saratoga to return to the starting area.  Black and Gist contain sustained
10% grades... normally this grade seems steep, but after what you will have
just been through, it will be but a warm-down.
